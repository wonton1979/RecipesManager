Warm the olive oil in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat and fry the peppers, garlic and bay leaves for 10 mins, stirring often until the peppers have softened. \n\n 2. Meanwhile, prepare the saffron potatoes. Put the saffron threads in a small heatproof bowl with 1 tbsp boiling water, the olive oil and garlic, and stir well until the liquid turns yellow. Set aside. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, and cook the sliced potatoes for 5 mins until tender but not collapsing. Drain well.\n\n 3. When the peppers have softened, sprinkle over the paprika and stir briefly, then pour in the stock and passata and cook for 5 mins more. Remove from the heat and stir in the shrimp, cod, olives and parsley, if using. Tip the stew into a large, shallow pie dish (ours was 30 x 20cm, and about 6.5cm deep).\n\n 4. Arrange the potato slices over the stew in an even layer – they don’t have to be neat – then generously brush over the saffron mixture.\n\n 5. Bake the pie for 30-35 mins until bubbling at the edges and the fish is cooked through. When it’s almost finished cooking, boil or steam the broccoli or green beans to serve alongside the pie."

Add some strips of parchment that hang over the sides of the tin to help lift the tiramisu out. Beat the egg yolks and sugar together using an electric whisk until pale, thick and doubled in volume. Add the mascarpone and marsala, and whisk again for about 3 mins to combine.\n\n 2. Whisk the cream and 3 tbsp of the pistachio spread together in a separate bowl until the mixture just holds its shape, then fold this into the mascarpone mixture. Clean the beaters and whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks in a third bowl, then fold this into the pistachio-mascarpone mixture. Keep chilled.\n\n 3. Whisk the coffee, amaretto and 2 tbsp pistachio spread together in a shallow dish. Dip the sponge fingers into the mix briefly on both sides, then arrange in a single layer in the base of the tin. Spoon over a third of the filling, then repeat the process twice, alternating between the sponge fingers and filling.\n\n 4. Chill for 3-4 hrs, or overnight. Transfer to a serving plate, drizzle over the melted pistachio spread in a criss-cross pattern, and sprinkle the slivered pistachios around the edge. Will keep chilled for two days."

Snap away the claws from the lobster. Using a large chef’s knife, cut the lobster in half and wash the head cavity under cold water, then dry with kitchen paper. Lay the lobsters, cut side up, on a baking tray. Crack the claws and remove the claw meat. Divide claw meat between the head cavities. This can be done the day before and the lobster kept in the fridge ready for grilling.\n\n 3. Heat grill to high. Slice the butter into thin rounds and lay it along the lobsters so all the meat is covered. Grill for 5-8 mins until the butter is bubbling and starting to brown. Put the lobsters on plates, pouring any butter from the tray over them. Serve with new potatoes and some dressed salad leaves."

Warm over a low heat to dissolve the sugar and melt the butter, stirring occasionally.\n\n 2. When the sugar has dissolved, put a sugar thermometer in the mixture, making sure the end is completely covered by the syrup – if it’s not, transfer the mixture to a smaller pan that’s still large enough for the syrup to bubble. Turn up the heat to medium-high and bring the syrup to the boil, stirring occasionally to stop it catching. When the thermometer reaches 116C – or ‘soft ball’ stage, remove the pan from the heat.\n\n 3. Leave the mixture to stand, undisturbed, for 5 mins, until the temperature drops to 110C, then stir in the vanilla bean paste and a good pinch of salt.\n\n 4. Remove the thermometer, then vigorously beat the mixture with a wooden spoon, checking the temperature every minute or so until it drops again to about 60C. By this time, the mixture will be really thick and have lost its glossy shine. Take the thermometer out and continue beating the mixture for a few more minutes. This part is crucial as it helps create small sugar crystals that give the fudge its smooth, creamy texture.\n\n 5. Quickly pour the fudge mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the surface using a spatula. Dot the caramel over the top, and swirl it through the fudge using a skewer. Sprinkle with 1 tsp sea salt, then leave to cool overnight at room temperature – don’t put it in the fridge, as it will become sticky and won’t set properly. Cut into 36 bite-sized pieces. Will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two months."

Cover with a lid and cook in the oven at 150C/130C fan/gas 2 for anywhere between 4 and 8 hrs until falling apart. Check every few hours in case it gets dry – if it does, add another mugful of cider.\n\n 4. Take it out of the oven and put the meat in a big dish, leaving the liquid in the casserole.\n\n 5. Cut the skin off, then shred the meat using two forks. Ditch any fatty bits, and skim any excess fat off the surface of the sauce.\n\n 6. Add a mugful of a good smoky BBQ sauce to the casserole, mix it in, then ladle some into a bowl for dipping.\n\n 7. Put the pulled pork back in the casserole with the juices so it stays moist. Season to taste. Can be made one day ahead.\n\n 8. Serve in soft white rolls with coleslaw and the bowl of juices on the side for ‘French dipping’ the sandwich while you’re eating."

      "instructions": "1. Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.\n\n 2. Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.\n\n 3. While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.\n\n 4. Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.\n\n 5. Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred.\n\n 6. Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.\n\n 7. Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row.\n\n 8. Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.\n\n 9. Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.\n\n 10. Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.\n\n 11. Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.\n\n 12. Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm.\n\n 13. Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.\n\n 14. Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.\n\n 15. Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides.\n\n 16. Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.\n\n 17. Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.\n\n 18. Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.\n\n 19. Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices."
